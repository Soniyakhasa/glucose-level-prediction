# Glucose Level Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a regression model to predict glucose levels based on demographic and clinical features.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze the relationship between age and glucose levels and evaluate statistical significance.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

## 📊 Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression model building
- Assumption testing (Normality, Homoscedasticity)
- Model evaluation using R-squared and p-values

## 📈 Key Insights
- Age showed statistically significant impact on glucose levels (p < 0.05)
- Model explained variation using linear regression framework

## 📌 Conclusion
The regression model provides interpretable insights for predictive healthcare analytics.
